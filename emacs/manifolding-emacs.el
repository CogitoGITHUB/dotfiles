`:reading'), so the splash names each file while it is read.
Each unit loads from its compiled .elc on an exact parts-hash match
— nothing recompiles, nothing re-evaluates from source.  Changed
units byte-compile fresh; compile failures fall back to interpreted
eval.  FORCE recompiles and reloads everything.  Per-unit durations
and statuses land in `manifolding-emacs--unit-times' and
`unit-times.log', so slow units are measured, never guessed.
Artifacts of deleted units are pruned.  Returns the files that
compiled, in completion order."
